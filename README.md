# iScroll 5 beta 1

Detailed documentation soon to come. In the meantime please reference to the examples in the demos directory.
Note: The global variable in iScroll 5 is called `IScroll` while it was `iScroll` in verion 4.

## Build system (for developers only)

iScroll comes with a custom build system. The required nodejs packages are included in the package.json. To build all main releases just do:

	./build.js dist

The compiled scripts will be saved in the /build and /dist directories.
